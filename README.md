# maestro
A CLT (Command Line Tool) for managing ML experiments (designed for Oberman Lab, but can be used for anything else).

## Overview

The purpose of maestro is to ease the process of running experiments. Whether it be batches or a single script, maestro has an easy-to-use interface for those who have used CLTs before, and even if not, it was designed for ease-of-use in mind.

### Features
1. Easy to use interface
2. Built-in script dispatcher
 1. Ability to block GPUs
 2. Ability to spread processes over GPUs
3. Auto-completion and bash-like file globbing
4. Process monitoring
5. Ability to kill processes

## Features To Come

I plan on still working on maestro to add features like showing the log directory of an ML experiment (hopefully I can get that out soon). If you have any feature or change that you'd like to see implemented or done, please send me an email.

## Update

I plan on refactoring code and making it more manageable to read and organize over the coming months.
